# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. They are mostly here so I can keep my desktop and laptop in sync.

Enjoy at your own risk.

If you see something here that you made and I am using, thanks for the shit.

I've modified some of these to my liking, but here's where some of them came from:

* .Xdefaults from @nickfletcher
* tmux config from http://dotshare.it/dots/1052/
* ...
* Probably others. Grats for your sweet stuff. I like it.
